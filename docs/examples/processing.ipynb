    "Processing large amounts of data in Python can be as fast as in C++ if one uses Numpy and Numba effectively, and if data structures of the underlying C++ library can be directly access as Numpy array views. Unfortunately, the internal design of the C++ HepMC3 library does not allow us to do that. Therefore, processing a GenEvent in Python cannot be as fast as in C++.\n",
